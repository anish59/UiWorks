    steps:

        ===========================================================
        <resources>
            <attr name="font" format="string" />
            <declare-styleable name="CEditText">
                <attr name="font" />
            </declare-styleable>

            <declare-styleable name="CTextView">
                <attr name="font" />
            </declare-styleable>
        </resources>

        4. Add this in Strings.xml <string name="acme_regular">acme_regular.ttf</string>
        5. Create Custom EditText(or textView or Button) (refer CEditText)
